## :rocket: Getting Started

This project uses a MySQL database for data persistence. You should have MySQL
up and running. For setting up a successful connection, the environment
variables must be set. To obtain the songs you have got to have a running server
instance.

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

After this, you must fill in the fields correctly and export them in your
environment. Checkout [direnv](https://direnv.net/) for your shell and
[EnvFile](https://github.com/Ashald/EnvFile) for IntelliJ.

### :hammer: Development

Compile and run the client in a clean build.

```
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

Start a server instance.

```
mvn exec:java@server
```

Running tests.

```
mvn test
```

Format the code accordingly to common guide lines.

```
mvn formatter:format
```

Lint your code with _checkstyle_.

```
mvn checkstyle:check
```

### :package: Deployment

Bundling the app into jar file.

```
mvn package
```

### :hammer_and_wrench: Tools

The recommended Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is IntelliJ IDEA. For
the design it's recommended to install JavaFX Scene Builder.
